Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Install the necessary libraries by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
pip install SpeechRecognition


Step 2: Code Implementation
Create a Python script and import the required libraries. Here's an example code:
import speech_recognition as sr
import os
import webbrowser


Step 3: Define Functions for Voice Command Recognition
Define functions to capture audio, recognize speech, and execute actions based on recognized commands:
def recognize_command():
    # Initialize the recognizer
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

    # Capture audio from the microphone
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Say something...")
        recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)
        audio = recognizer.listen(source, timeout=5)

    try:
        # Use Google Speech Recognition to convert audio to text
        command = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        print(f"Command recognized: {command}")
        execute_command(command)
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Sorry, could not understand audio.")
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print(f"Error with the speech recognition service; {e}")

def execute_command(command):
    # Define actions based on recognized commands
    if "open" in command:
        open_application(command)
    elif "search" in command:
        search_web(command)
    else:
        print("Command not recognized.")

def open_application(command):
    # Extract the application name from the command and open it
    # You can customize this part based on the applications you want to open
    if "notepad" in command:
        os.system("notepad.exe")
    elif "calculator" in command:
        os.system("calc.exe")
    else:
        print("Application not supported.")

def search_web(command):
    # Extract the search query from the command and perform a web search
    query = command.replace("search", "").strip()
    search_url = f"https://www.google.com/search?q={query}"
    webbrowser.open(search_url)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    recognize_command()


Step 4: Run the Code
Execute the script, and it will prompt you to speak a command. The script will recognize the command using Google Speech Recognition and attempt to execute it.
python your_script_name.py


Note: Ensure that your microphone is properly connected and configured. Also, you may need to modify the execute_command function to match the applications you want to open or actions you want to perform based on recognized commands.
